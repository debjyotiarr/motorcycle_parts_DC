# Motorcycle Parts
Project completed in DataCamp. It explores a database and queries it to produce a table of different products and how much revenue it generates.

This project was one of the guided projects on the DataCamp website which needs to be solved using SQL. The summary of the table contents is given in the uploaded ipynb file. The goal is to generate a table with all the products and calculate the net revenue each generates. The table was queried once to see the data. The given data is clean. 

The SQL query is slowly built up to the present form. 

This demonstrates the use of the CASE WHEN clause in SQL along with the other oft used clauses like ORDER BY and GROUP BY.
